"""
What is an object? Objects have methods like these and attributes
that you can access with the DOT method. Now OOP allows the programmer to 
go beyond what Python just gives us (these data types) and create out own.
Why is this useful? OOP is a paradigm, it's a way for us to think about our
code and structure in a way that is easier to maintain, extend and write.
